The VRT Builder is a plugin to create GDAL Virtual Raster (VRT) files by drag and drop. 
It helps to create new images by stacking or mosaicing of source image bands, as well as to 
describe band- and spatial subsets. 

The VRT Builder is developed at Geographic Institute of Humboldt-Universit√§t zu Berlin within the EnMAP-Box 
project under contract of the German Research Centre for Geosciences (GFZ). 

The EnMAP-Box project is part of the EnMAP Core Science Team activities (www.enmap.org), funded by the 
German Aerospace Center (DLR) and granted by the Federal Ministry of 
Economic Affairs and Energy (BMWi, grant no. 50EE1529).
