The Virtual Raster Builder is a [QGIS](http://www.qgis.org) plugin to create
[GDAL](http://gdal.org) [Virtual Raster (VRT)](http://www.gdal.org/gdal_vrttut.html).
It offers an graphical user interface to describe the structure of 
a new virtual raster image (VRT) , e.g. by drag and drop of source bands into the 
final VRT structure.
